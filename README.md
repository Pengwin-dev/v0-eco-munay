# EcoMunay ‚ôªÔ∏è
**Incentivizing Recycling Onchain on Base**

EcoMunay is a web3 mini-app built on the Base network that tackles the challenge of waste management in Latin America. We provide a decentralized platform that rewards users for recycling PET bottles through blockchain-verified, instant digital rewards, turning environmental action into an economic opportunity.

## üéØ The Problem

Recycling infrastructure in many parts of Latin America is limited, with few direct incentives for individuals to recycle. This results in more waste going to landfills and environmental pollution, while a valuable resource stream remains underutilized.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

EcoMunay bridges this gap by creating a transparent, onchain reward system:

- **Users deliver PET bottles** to smart recycling centers
- **Deposits are verified** using blockchain smart contracts  
- **Users instantly receive** MUNAY tokens and non-transferable NFT receipts as proof of recycling on the Base network
- **Redeemable vouchers** (ERC20-like tokens) can be used at partnered local retailers
- **All transactions are recorded onchain**, ensuring trust, transparency, and community ownership

This incentivizes recycling behavior and fosters new economic opportunities for local communities.
