# EcoMunay ‚ôªÔ∏è

**Incentivizing Recycling Onchain**

EcoMunay is a web3 mini-app built on the **Base** network that tackles the challenge of waste management in Latin America. We've created a decentralized platform that rewards users for recycling, turning environmental action into an economic opportunity.

## üéØ The Problem

In many parts of Latin America, recycling infrastructure is limited, and there are few direct incentives for individuals to participate. This leads to increased landfill waste and environmental pollution, while a valuable stream of recyclable materials goes untapped.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

EcoMunay bridges this gap by creating a transparent, onchain reward system.

1.  Users deliver their PET bottles to smart recycling centers.
2.  The deposit is verified, and the user is instantly rewarded with tokens on the Base network.
3.  All transactions are recorded onchain, creating a verifiable and community-owned ledger of environmental impact.

This process creates a powerful flywheel: individuals are financially motivated to recycle, and communities gain a new, sustainable economic layer.

## üèÜ Hackathon Tracks

EcoMunay is competing in the following tracks, where we believe our project strongly aligns with the core goals and technologies.

### 1. Base Mini Apps Track
- **Why we fit:** EcoMunay is a **Base-native mini-app** designed from the ground up to be "simple, snappy, and fun." Our goal is to provide an instant, engaging onchain experience directly within the Base ecosystem, perfectly matching the track's objective.

### 2. V0 by Vercel Track
- **Why we fit:** We leveraged **v0** to rapidly translate our ideas from natural language into a functional user interface. The entire front-end was built using v0 with Next.js and Tailwind, and is deployed on **Vercel**.

### 3. Public Good for LATAM (Crecimiento & ENS)
- **Why we fit:** EcoMunay directly addresses a **critical real-world problem in Latin America:** waste management. By building an open and accessible onchain incentive system, we are creating a **public good** that promotes environmental sustainability and provides new economic opportunities.
